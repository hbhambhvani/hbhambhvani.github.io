Last night, we wandered into the charming, sophisticated—and yes, expensive AF—depths of the West Village for an experience like no other. Finally out of our scrubs and into our shorts, we burst through the doors at the exclusive Bangkok Supper Club for our highly coveted 9:00PM reservation.

<u>Hokkaido Scallop Ceviche</u><br>
Delicate and unassuming on the outside but spicy and sharp on the inside, this inventive dish felt like a hug from Clara. We came for the silky touch of the scallop but stayed for the exquisite contrast of mint, garlic, chili, and watermelon.

<u>Khao Mun Gai</u><br> 
Careful with this one. If you don’t read the menu carefully (like us), one bite will leave you completely confused. Chicken wing on the outside and sweet, spicy ginger rice on the inside, the texture on this guy was unbelievable.

<u>Pork Jowl</u><br>
Thanks to this one, we all learned what jowl is. And we became closer than ever before. But more importantly, we gained a new appreciation for the droopy, saggy bits of animals. Smoky, fatty, and accompanied by delicious spicy pork cracklings.

<u>Green Beans</u><br>
Shoutout to our waitress for reminding us to put something green on the table. Simplistic yet elegant in presentation, these beans were one of Professor N’s favorites. Nominated as the unsung hero of the night by both the small bowels and the large bowels.

<u>Beef Cheeks Massaman Curry</u><br>
Yet another fragment of the face, prepared flawlessly for our enjoyment. I had no idea beef could be this tender. As a man of few words, you know Mark means business when he speaks. His solemn praise of “the cheeks” will live rent free in my head until 2026.

<u>Crying Tiger</u><br>
The crowd favorite, hands down. Only Professor B was bold enough to propose ordering this $120 steak, but my god was it worth it. Perfectly sauced, charred, and grilled. We could have easily ordered 2 more. I don’t blame Hriday for asking the waiter if the bone was edible, but we should really make an effort to learn non-urologic things.  

<u>Sweet Potato Ice Cream</u><br>
A refreshing end to the barrage of unique flavors and spices. The real hero here was the base of warm sticky rice pudding which paired perfectly with the ice cream on top. 4 guys 1 bowl, just the way we like it.

**Assessment:** 
In summary, Bangkok Supper Club is a stylish and flavor-packed temple of modern Thai dining. The Crying Tiger alone is worth the visit, but the supporting cast makes this a full production worth remembering. Come hungry, come early, and maybe bring some omeprazole. Final Professor rating: 9.1/10. 

**Plan:** 
•	Return with stretchy pants
•	Reorder Crying Tiger x2
