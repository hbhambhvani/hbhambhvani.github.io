The second instillment of the supper club began weeks ago, with a clutch 9:01AM resy by Prof B at one of the more elusive tables in the city - **Semma**, a trendy south Indian spot in the West Village and holder of one Michelin star. As with our didactic curriculum, we showed up at an inopportune time (9:30PM) with no idea what to expect. Luckily our resident Alabamian Indian did the pre-reading and came prepared with what promised to be a strong slate of dishes. Here are the highlights: 

<u>Paniyaram</u><br>
Crusty exterior and soft pillowy interior adorned with a flavorful tomato based sauce, this is the Joe Del Pizzo of appetizers<br>
¬†¬†
<u>Gunpowder Dosa</u><br> 
The most renowned dish on offer at Semma certainly did not disappoint. Presented as a perfect glistening triangle, this is a geometric masterpiece the likes of which we have not seen since we burned the midnight oil every Friday staring at kidney stones of various shapes and sizes with Luay. Notably, sambar was mid per Prof B, MBBS 

<u>Attu Kari Sukka</u><br>
Spicy. Meaty. These short ribs were mini but mighty and definitely packed a punch. But it felt good, right Mike Tzeng?

<u>Goanese Oxtail</u><br>
Wow was this phenomenal. If you would have seen Prof B sucking down these bones you‚Äôd think this guy hadn‚Äôt seen food for a year. But alas, a garden cafe and Taco Bell based diet will do that to you.

<u>Vailya Chemmeen Moilee</u><br>
Lobster. Bathed in a turmeric and coconut curry. This dish is almost as rich as Rich Lee. You might even catch it on first ave with a G shock and a high sierra backpack. 

<u>Passion Fruit Pudding</u><br>
The perfect closer. This dish was zesty, tangy and almost too pretty to eat. You know who else is almost too pretty to eat? Braian. But that didn‚Äôt stop Mike Tzeng.

**Assessment:** 
In summary, this is a trendy and exclusive Michelin starred South Indian restaurant. While tables are hard to come by, it is well worth the effort and will leave you sucking down bones like your primary form of sustenance is Garden Cafe underbaked pizza. Final Professor rating: 8.9/10.
