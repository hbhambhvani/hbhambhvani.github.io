Our PGY4 crew headed to **Eyval**, a Persian restaurant in Brooklyn with grilled meats that probably cured our burnout (temporarily). While Behnam is deathly sensitive to fava beans, precluding us from ordering the fava bean borani, we indulged in most everything else. We ordered the Shiraz salad because Mike Tzeng needed some greens in his diet after eating flaming hot cheetos with nitrile gloves all year round - it was delightlfully tangy and hit the spot. The koobideh was elite. The eggplant dip got reordered. There was a spirited debate about whether research year counts as “real work.”

Eyval gave us the kind of dinner that reminded us why we love New York: bold flavors, too many small plates, and plenty of chaotic energy.
