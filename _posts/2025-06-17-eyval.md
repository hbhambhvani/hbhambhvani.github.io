Our inaugural supper club meal began with **Eyval**, a Persian restaurant in Brooklyn with grilled meats that probably cured our burnout (temporarily). Some highlights: 

<u>The Shiraz Salad</u>
We mainly ordered this because Mike Tzeng needed some greens in his diet after eating flaming hot cheetos with nitrile gloves all year round - it was delightlfully tangy and hit the spot. Mike's fiber content has never been higher.

<u>Ghormeh Sabzi</u>
When I tell you Mark's eyes lit up after a spoon of this stew in a manner I have not seen since in the last 12 months - it was honestly magical. It was as if the sleep debt from the last 14 days of post-call operating vanished in a moment, and he began to see life in a light that he forgot was possible. On top of that, our resident Persian, Behnam, said this might be the best Gormeh Sabzi in the city - woah. High praise. 

<u>Saffron Ice Cream Sandwich</u>
With bellies full, and wellness meters on maximum, when the waitress came by and asked if we'd like to see the desesrt menu - we couldn't help but take a peak. The saffron ice cream sandwich was floral, heavy on the saffron in the most perfect manner, and just indulgent enough to make us forget our pending didactic responsibilities for exactly seven perfect minutes.

Eyval gave us the kind of dinner that reminded us why we love New York: bold flavors, too many small plates, and plenty of chaotic energy.
