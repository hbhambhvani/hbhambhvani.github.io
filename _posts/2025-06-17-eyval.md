Our PGY4 crew headed to **Eyval**, a Persian restaurant in Brooklyn with grilled meats that probably cured someone’s burnout (temporarily). The koobideh was elite. The eggplant dip got reordered. There was a spirited debate about whether research year counts as “real work.”

Eyval gave us the kind of dinner that reminded us why we love New York: bold flavors, too many small plates, and plenty of chaotic energy.
