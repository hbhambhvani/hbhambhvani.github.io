Our inaugural supper club meal began with **Eyval**, a Persian restaurant in Brooklyn with grilled meats that probably cured our burnout (temporarily). Some highlights: 

<u>The Shiraz Salad</u>

We mainly ordered this because Mike Tzeng needed some greens in his diet after eating flaming hot cheetos with nitrile gloves all year round - it was delightlfully tangy and hit the spot. Mike's fiber content has never been higher.

<u>Ghormeh Sabzi</u>

When I tell you Mark's eyes lit up after a spoon of this stew + bone marrow combo in a manner I have not seen since in the last 12 months - it was honestly magical. It was as if the sleep debt from the last 14 days of post-call operating vanished in a moment, and he began to see life in a light that he forgot was possible. On top of that, our resident Persian, Behnam, said this might be the best Gormeh Sabzi in the city - woah. High praise. 

<u>Saffron Ice Cream Sandwich</u>

With bellies full, and wellness meters on maximum, when the waitress came by and asked if we'd like to see the desesrt menu - we couldn't help but take a peak. The saffron ice cream sandwich immediately called to us. This was like no ice cream sandwich we had had before, but in the best way possible. Truly the perfect level of indulgence -  just enough to make us forget our impending didactic responsibilities for exactly seven perfect minutes. Observe the pistachio-lined edges of this rare delicacy‚Äîglimpsed for a fleeting 0.7 seconds before being swiftly claimed by Mike, a known apex predator for all sweetened goods.

**Assessment:**
In summary, patient is a 3-year-old Persian restaurant presenting with banging flavor, perfectly carbonated Doogh, and a truly insane Gormeh Sabzi. Final Professor rating 8.6/10.

**Plan:**
Return in 4-6 weeks. Bring Behnam a Benadryl and maybe let him risk the fava.
